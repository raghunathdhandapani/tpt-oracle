# usage: ./cbchammer2 <num_loops>
# notes:
#  the updated version will do an exclusive CBC get every 1000 loop iterations for long-running tasks
#  so if you schedule only 1000 loop iterations per connect, these guys will do just shared gets
#  after 1000th iteration we consider the task long running and they will start doing a select for update
#  with exclusive CBC get every 1000 iterations
# 
# schema creation:
# 
#  CREATE TABLE cbchammer (a INT);
#  INSERT INTO cbchammer VALUES (1);
#  INSERT INTO cbchammer VALUES (2);
#  COMMIT;
#  EXEC DBMS_STATS.GATHER_TABLE_STATS(user, 'CBCHAMMER')
